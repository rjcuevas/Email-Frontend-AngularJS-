    "    <code>ng-boilerplate</code> is an opinionated kickstarter for web\n" +
    "    development projects. It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new\n" +
    "    web sites and apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to\n" +
    "    have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has\n" +
    "    slick styles and icons, but it also has a best practice directory structure\n" +
    "    to ensure maximum code reuse. And it's all tied together with a robust\n" +
    "    build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.\n" +
    "  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <h2>Why?</h2>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <p>\n" +
    "    Because my team and I make web apps, and \n" +
    "    last year AngularJS became our client-side framework of choice. We start\n" +
    "    websites the same way every time: create a directory structure, copy and\n" +
    "    ever-so-slightly tweak some config files from an older project, and yada\n" +
    "    yada, etc., and so on and so forth. Why are we repeating ourselves? We wanted a starting point; a set of\n" +
    "    best practices that we could identify our projects as embodying and a set of\n" +
    "    time-saving wonderfulness, because time is money.\n" +
    "  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <p>\n" +
    "    There are other similar projects out there, but none of them suited our\n" +
    "    needs. Some are awesome but were just too much, existing more as reference\n" +
    "    implementations, when we really just wanted a kickstarter. Others were just\n" +
    "    too little, with puny build systems and unscalable architectures.  So we\n" +
    "    designed <code>ng-boilerplate</code> to be just right.\n" +
    "  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <h2>What ng-boilerplate Is Not</h2>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <p>\n" +
    "    This is not an example of an AngularJS app. This is a kickstarter. If\n" +

    "        href=\"https://github.com/angular-app/angular-app/\">angular-app</a></code>, \n" +

    "    GitHub.\n" +
    "  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <p>\n" +
    "    The high-altitude view is that the base project includes \n" +
    "    <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">Twitter Bootstrap</a>\n" +
    "    styles to quickly produce slick-looking responsive web sites and apps. It also\n" +
    "    includes <a href=\"http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap\">UI Bootstrap</a>,\n" +
    "    a collection of native AngularJS directives based on the aforementioned\n" +
    "    templates and styles. It also includes <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/\">Font Awesome</a>,\n" +
    "    a wicked-cool collection of font-based icons that work swimmingly with all\n" +
    "    manner of web projects; in fact, all images on the site are actually font-\n" +
    "    based icons from Font Awesome. Neat! Lastly, this also includes\n" +
    "    <a href=\"http://joshdmiller.github.com/angular-placeholders\">Angular Placeholders</a>,\n" +
    "    a set of pure AngularJS directives to do client-side placeholder images and\n" +

    "    And, of course, <code>ng-boilerplate</code> is built on <a href=\"http://angularjs.org\">AngularJS</a>,\n" +
    "    by the far the best JavaScript framework out there! But if you don't know\n" +
    "    that already, then how did you get here? Well, no matter - just drink the\n" +

    "      href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">hop on over</a> and check it out; it's\n" +
    "    pretty sweet. Anyway, all that wonderful stylistic goodness comes built in.\n" +
    "    The LESS files are available for you to import in your main stylesheet as\n" +
    "    needed - no excess, no waste. There is also a dedicated place to override\n" +
    "    variables and mixins to suit your specific needs, so updating to the latest\n" +
    "    version of Bootstrap is as simple as: \n" +
    "  </p>\n" +

    "  <pre>$ cd vendor/twitter-bootstrap<br />$ git pull origin master</pre>\n" +

    "    What's better than Bootstrap styles? Bootstrap directives!  The fantastic <a href=\"http://angular-ui.github.com/bootstrap\">UI Bootstrap</a>\n" +
    "    library contains a set of native AngularJS directives that are endlessly\n" +
    "    extensible. You get the tabs, the tooltips, the accordions. You get your\n" +
    "    carousel, your modals, your pagination. And <i>more</i>.\n" +
    "    How about a quick demo? \n" +
    "  </p>\n" +

    "  <p>\n" +
    "    Font Awesome has earned its label. It's a set of open (!) icons that come\n" +
    "    distributed as a font (!) for super-easy, lightweight use. Font Awesome \n" +
    "    works really well with Twitter Bootstrap, and so fits right in here.\n" +
    "  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <p>\n" +
    "    There is not a single image on this site. All of the little images and icons \n" +

    "  <pre>&lt;i class=\"fa fa-flag\"&gt;&lt/i&gt</pre>\n" +
    "\n" +

    "  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <h2>Placeholders</h2>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <p>\n" +
    "    Angular Placeholders is a simple library for mocking up text and images. You\n" +
    "    can automatically throw around some \"lorem ipsum\" text:\n" +
    "  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <pre>&lt;p ph-txt=\"3s\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n" +
    "\n" +

    "\n" +
    "  <div class=\"pre\">\n" +
    "    &lt;p&gt;\n" +
    "    <p ph-txt=\"3s\"></p>\n" +
    "    &lt;/p&gt;\n" +
    "  </div>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <p>\n" +
    "    Even more exciting, you can also create placeholder images, entirely \n" +
    "    client-side! For example, this:\n" +
    "  </p>\n" +
    "  \n" +
    "  <pre>\n" +
    "&lt;img ph-img=\"50x50\" /&gt;\n" +
    "&lt;img ph-img=\"50x50\" class=\"img-polaroid\" /&gt;\n" +
    "&lt;img ph-img=\"50x50\" class=\"img-rounded\" /&gt;\n" +
    "&lt;img ph-img=\"50x50\" class=\"img-circle\" /&gt;</pre>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <p>\n" +
    "    Gives you this:\n" +
    "  </p>\n" +
    "\n" +
    "  <div>\n" +
    "    <img ph-img=\"50x50\" />\n" +
